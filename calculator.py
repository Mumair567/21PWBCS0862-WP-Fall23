# In math we have BODMAS rule to calculate the equations but in python 
#If we have to calculate lengthy calculation then we use precedence rule and Associativity rule
#In precedence rule first of all parenthesis will be solved then exponent have higest precedence
# *,/,//,% they have same precedence and associativity from left to right
#example print((2+3)*5/6%2)
#first parenthesis will be solved then multilpy that with 5 then /6 then %2
# +,- Associativity from left to right
# Exponent associativity from right to left
print(2**3**2)
# from right side 3^2 means 9 and then 2^9 equal to 512
